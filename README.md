# React Frontend for Auto Checkout Functionality
This React frontend is used in conjunction with a Node.js backend to implement auto checkout functionality for an e-commerce website. The frontend is responsible for displaying the product inventory, collecting customer information for checkout, and submitting checkout requests to the backend.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-checkout.git

2. Navigate to the react-frontend directory:
cd auto-checkout/react-frontend

3. Install the dependencies:
npm install


4. Copy the .env.example file to .env:
cp .env.example .env


5. Set the REACT_APP_API_URL variable in the .env file to the URL of your Node.js backend:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

6. Start the development server:
npm start



## Usage
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3001. You can now use the web interface to browse the product inventory, add products to your cart, and checkout.

## Components
1. The frontend is built using the following React components:

2. App: The main application component that renders the product inventory, cart, and checkout pages.

3. Inventory: Renders the product inventory and allows users to add products to their cart.

4. Cart: Renders the user's cart and allows them to remove items or proceed to checkout.

5. CheckoutForm: Collects the user's information for checkout and sends a request to the backend to complete the checkout process.
